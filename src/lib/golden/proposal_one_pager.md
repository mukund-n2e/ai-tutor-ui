# Proposal: ACME Demo Lift
## KPI
Increase qualified demos from 22→35/week by Dec 15.
## Options (A/B/C)
- Option A — Audit + quick wins (USD $3k–$5k) — Trade-off: limited depth
- Option B — Funnel rebuild (USD $7k–$10k) — Trade-off: longer timeline
- Option C — Rebuild + SDR playbook (USD $12k–$15k) — Trade-off: higher lift
## Scope
- Map current funnel and data sources
- Draft new demo request form & routing
- Implement lead scoring v1
- Train SDR on new playbook
## Timeline
Start: Week 1 • Milestone: Week 2 handoff • End: Week 3 go-live
## Investment & Next Step
USD $7k–$10k (Option B). Next: Book a 30-min kickoff this week.
Similarity gate: Jaccard tri-gram ≥ 0.35 (soft; allow one auto-regen if lower).
